this is the repository to store my dotfiles and other configuration files.

this repository uses informal language because professional language is passive aggressive.

documentation and comments are written in a way that is easy to understand
and with a particular grammitical style.
sentences do not start with a capital letter.
the word "i" is always lowercase.
however, proper nouns are _always_ capitalized, i.e. "NixOS", "Linux", "GitHub", etc.
semantic line breaks are used to separate sentences
and parts of sentences.
this is to limit line length
and to make diffs easier to read and analyze.

the main shell used is `nushell`.
the main editor used is `neovim`.
the main terminal used is `ghostty`.

there is quite a bit of NixOS configuration that is used
to build my homelab Linux systems.
the NixOS configuration is in the `nixos` directory.

code should be written in a way that is easy to read
and documented heavily with comments including links where possible.
