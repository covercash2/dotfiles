# NeoVim config

based on [`lazyvim`] and heavily relying on [`lazy.nvim`].

## organization

the following are conventions based on [`lazyvim`]:

- plugins are individually or logically grouped (e.g. by programming language)
    in the `./lua/plugins` dir.
- configuration including keymaps and [`lazy.nvim`] setup is located
    in the `./lua/config` dir.
